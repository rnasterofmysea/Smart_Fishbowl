## 1. Water Temperature Management System

  - Setting defualt temperature cased by fish type
  - Measuring water temperature apart from water heater
  - Monitoring by senior monitor and controling survo motor to handel heater
  
## 2. Feeding System

  - Set feeding time
  - Controling servo motor to dorp feed from the box
  
## 3. Filtering System

  - Measuring turbidity & sensor to judge water pollution degree
  - Operating water pump if water pullution degree is over
  - Absorbing water from water tank (which planted waterplant)
  
## 4. Water Level Management System

  - Measuring water level
  - Operating water pump if water level is lower than common level
  - If water level is not filled, alert user to notice it

## 5. PH Level Management System

 - Measuring & monitoring PH level
 - If ph level is caution level, drop water quality medicine
